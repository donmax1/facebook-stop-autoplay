facebook-stop-autoplay
======================
This is an extension that allows people to control if they want their videos to auto-play when scrolling. Facebook introduced this feature back in February '14 and many prefer to turn it off.

The [Chrome extension is available](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mbelfagicfcmhndmbecodgmfkghpbmdi) for free.
